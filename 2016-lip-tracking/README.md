# Visual speech (lip movement) entrainment 👄
This study is the first demonstration of visual speech entrainment. We  investigated how lip movement interacts with rhythmic brain activity in participants listening to and seeing the speaker in a cocktail party situation. 

We found that the area of the observer’s brain that controls the lips (the motor cortex) also produced brain waves that were synchronized to lip movements. Volunteers whose motor cortex was more synchronized to the lip movements understood speech better.
