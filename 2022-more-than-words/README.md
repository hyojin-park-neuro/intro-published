# More than Words: Topic keywords processing in the brain in multi-speaker environment

Neural signatures of the semantic gist of a story (topic keywords processing) are attainable via applications of machine learning or deep learning-based NLP technique on the materials used in the neuroimaging study. 
Task-relevant speech chunks containing topic keywords are processed in the known language brain regions and sensorimotor cortices when compared to those with semantically less critical words. 
Using brain responses-stimuli mapping functions by encoding and decoding model approaches (figure below), task-irrelevant speech chunks containing topic keywords are reconstructed from the brain responses to a similar degree to those of task-relevant speech chunks. 
Increased sensitivity to semantically salient task-irrelevant speech in the left auditory-motor brain areas exhibits a detrimental effect on the understanding of task-relevant speech.
