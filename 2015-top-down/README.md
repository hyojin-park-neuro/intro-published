# Top-down modulation of speech entrainment

This study provides new insights into the role of low-frequency oscillations in top-down control during continuous speech processing.  We show that causal top-down signals from frontal and motor areas largely directed at left auditory cortex. Furthermore, speech-auditory cortex coupling is enhanced as a function of stronger top-down signals.
